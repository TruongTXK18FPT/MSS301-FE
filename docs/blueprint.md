# **App Name**: MathMind

## Core Features:

- Interactive Math Exercises: Provide a variety of math exercises (MCQ, fill-in, T/F, drag & drop) for grades 1-12, using the cosmic visual theme.
- AI-Powered Chatbot: Implement a chatbot assistant to guide students in math topics. The bot will start with class level, then learning goals, and finally use these pieces of information as a tool to create a mindmap. The chatbot interface should have a floating dock, glass window and the user and bot bubbles need to be visually distinct.
- Cosmic Mindmap Editor: Develop a mindmap editor for planning and visualizing math concepts, displayed over a cosmic grid canvas. Allow users to export the generated mindmaps.
- Personalized Learning Roadmap: Curate personalized learning paths based on saved mindmaps. Display associated lessons, exercises and source citations (references to external sources).
- Dynamic Cosmic Background: Create a visually engaging animated cosmic background for the entire web application to match the design vision.
- Gamified Progress Tracking: Track user progress through the learning path with progress rings and achievement badges to make the practice fun and motivating.
